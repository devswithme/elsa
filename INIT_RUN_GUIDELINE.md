## Elsa Init Command

### Purpose
The `elsa init` command initializes a new `Elsafile` in the current directory, providing a foundation for project-specific automation commands.

### Syntax
```bash
elsa init
```

### What It Does

1. **Checks for Existing Elsafile**: Verifies that no `Elsafile` already exists in the current directory
2. **Creates Default Template**: Generates a new `Elsafile` with common Go project commands
3. **Sets Proper Permissions**: Creates the file with appropriate read/write permissions (0644)
4. **Provides Success Feedback**: Displays confirmation message with usage instructions

### Default Template Content

When you run `elsa init`, it creates an `Elsafile` with the following structure:

```bash
# Elsa - Engineer's Little Smart Assistant
# This file defines custom commands for your project
# Commands can be run using: elsa command_name or elsa run command_name

# Install elsa cli
install-tools:
	go install go.risoftinc.com/elsa/cmd/elsa@latest

# Build the project
build:
	go build -o bin/app .

# Run tests
test:
	go test ./...

# Clean build artifacts
clean:
	rm -rf bin/
	go clean

# Install dependencies
deps:
	go mod download
	go mod tidy

# Run the application
run:
	go run .

# Format code
fmt:
	go fmt ./...
	go vet ./...
```

### Error Handling

- **File Already Exists**: If `Elsafile` already exists, the command fails with an error message
- **Permission Issues**: If the directory is not writable, the command fails with a permission error
- **Template Generation**: If template generation fails, the command exits with an error

### Success Message

Upon successful creation, Elsa displays:

```
‚úÖ Created Elsafile successfully!
üìù You can now define custom commands in the Elsafile
üöÄ Run commands using: elsa run command_name

Example:
  elsa run build    # Run the build command
  elsa run test     # Run the test command
```

---

## Elsa Run Command

### Purpose
The `elsa run` command executes custom commands defined in the `Elsafile`, providing a flexible way to run project-specific automation tasks.

### Syntax
```bash
elsa run <command_name>
```

### What It Does

1. **Loads Elsafile**: Reads and parses the `Elsafile` from the current directory
2. **Validates Command**: Checks if the specified command exists in the Elsafile
3. **Executes Commands**: Runs the command(s) defined for the specified command name
4. **Handles Output**: Displays execution progress and results
5. **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for various failure scenarios

### Command Execution Process

1. **File Loading**: The system loads the `Elsafile` using the `Manager.Load()` method
2. **Command Lookup**: Searches for the specified command in the parsed command map
3. **Conflict Check**: Verifies if the command conflicts with built-in Elsa commands
4. **Execution**: Runs each command in the command definition sequentially
5. **Output Display**: Shows execution progress with emojis and formatted output

### Example Usage

```bash
# Run a build command
elsa run build

# Run a test command
elsa run test

# Run a custom command
elsa run deploy
```

### Command Execution Flow

```
üöÄ Running Elsafile command: build
üìù Executing: go build -o bin/app .

[Command output follows...]
```

### Error Scenarios

1. **Command Not Found**: `Error: command 'xyz' not found in Elsafile`
2. **Elsafile Not Found**: `Elsafile not found at . Run 'elsa init' to create one`
3. **Execution Failure**: Command execution errors are displayed with context
4. **No Command Specified**: `Error: No command specified. Use 'elsa run command_name'`

---

## Elsafile Structure

### File Format
The `Elsafile` uses a simple, YAML-like syntax for defining commands:

```bash
# Comments start with #
command_name:
	command_to_execute

# Multiple commands in one definition
complex_command:
	command1 && command2 && command3

# Multi-line commands with backslash continuation
multi_line_command:
	echo "Starting process" && \
	cd /path/to/directory && \
	./script.sh
```

### Command Definition Rules

1. **Command Names**: Must end with a colon (`:`)
2. **Indentation**: Commands must be indented with tabs (not spaces)
3. **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments
4. **Empty Lines**: Empty lines are ignored
5. **Line Continuation**: Use backslash (`\`) at the end of a line to continue on the next line

### Variable Substitution

Elsafile supports variable substitution for dynamic command execution:

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Use environment variables
test-env:
	echo "User: $USER"
	echo "Path: ${PATH}"
```

#### Interactive Input
```bash
# Prompt for user input if variable not in environment
migration-create:
	elsa migration create ddl ${?MIGRATION_NAME:Enter migration name}

# Simple prompt (uses variable name as prompt)
deploy:
	git push origin ${?BRANCH}
```

#### Variable Priority
1. **Environment Variables**: If the variable exists in the environment, use its value
2. **Interactive Input**: If not in environment, prompt the user for input

### Advanced Examples

```bash
# Complex setup with multiple variables
project-setup:
	echo "Setting up project: ${?PROJECT_NAME:Enter project name}" && \
	mkdir ${?PROJECT_NAME} && \
	cd ${?PROJECT_NAME} && \
	echo "Description: ${?DESCRIPTION:Enter description}"

# Mixed variable types
deploy-mixed:
	echo "User: $USER"  # Environment variable
	echo "Branch: ${?BRANCH:Enter branch name}"  # Interactive input
	echo "Environment: ${?ENV:Enter environment}"  # Interactive input
```

## Command Conflict Resolution

### Built-in Commands
Elsa has several built-in commands that take precedence over Elsafile commands:

- `init` - Initialize new Elsafile
- `run` - Run Elsafile commands
- `list` - List available commands
- `migrate` - Database migration commands
- `watch` - File watching commands
- `help` - Show help information
- `version` - Show version information

### Conflict Detection
When you try to run a command that conflicts with a built-in command, Elsa will:

1. **Detect the Conflict**: Identify that the command name matches a built-in command
2. **Show Warning**: Display a warning message about the conflict
3. **Provide Resolution**: Suggest using `elsa run <command>` to execute the Elsafile command
4. **Prevent Execution**: Block the execution to avoid confusion

### Conflict Resolution Examples

```bash
# This will show a conflict warning
elsa init  # Conflicts with built-in 'init' command

# Output:
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Command 'init' conflicts with a built-in Elsa command
# üí° Use 'elsa run init' to execute the Elsafile command
#    Or use 'elsa init' to run the built-in command

# To run the Elsafile command:
elsa run init

# To run the built-in command:
elsa init
```

### Non-Conflicting Commands
Commands that don't conflict with built-in commands can be run directly:

```bash
# These work directly (no conflict)
elsa build
elsa test
elsa deploy
elsa clean
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Command Execution
You can define multiple commands to run sequentially:

```bash
# All commands run in sequence
full-setup:
	go mod download && \
	go mod tidy && \
	go build -o bin/app . && \
	go test ./...
```

### Conditional Execution
Use shell operators for conditional execution:

```bash
# Only run if previous command succeeds
build-and-test:
	go build -o bin/app . && go test ./...

# Run regardless of previous command result
build-or-test:
	go build -o bin/app . ; go test ./...
```

### Environment-Specific Commands
Create commands for different environments:

```bash
# Development
dev:
	go run . --env=development

# Production
prod:
	go build -o bin/app . && ./bin/app --env=production

# Testing
test-env:
	go test ./... --env=testing
```

### Nested Commands
You can call other Elsafile commands from within commands:

```bash
# Master command that calls others
all:
	elsa run clean && \
	elsa run build && \
	elsa run test

# Individual commands
clean:
	rm -rf bin/
	go clean

build:
	go build -o bin/app .

test:
	go test ./...
```

## Best Practices

### Command Naming
- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Use kebab-case for multi-word commands (`deploy-staging`, `run-tests`)
- Avoid names that conflict with built-in commands
- Use consistent naming conventions across your team

### Command Organization
- Group related commands together
- Use comments to explain complex commands
- Keep commands focused on single responsibilities
- Use meaningful variable names for interactive inputs

### Error Handling
- Include error checking in your commands
- Use appropriate exit codes
- Provide clear error messages
- Test commands thoroughly before committing

### Documentation
- Comment complex commands
- Document required environment variables
- Provide examples in comments
- Keep the Elsafile readable and maintainable

### Example Well-Structured Elsafile

```bash
# Elsa - Engineer's Little Smart Assistant
# This file defines custom commands for our Go API project
# Commands can be run using: elsa command_name or elsa run command_name

# =============================================================================
# Development Commands
# =============================================================================

# Start development server with hot reload

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Elsafile not found" Error
**Problem**: Command fails with "Elsafile not found" error
**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're in the correct directory
- Run `elsa init` to create an Elsafile
- Check if the file is named exactly "Elsafile" (case-sensitive)

#### 2. "Command not found" Error
**Problem**: Command fails with "command 'xyz' not found in Elsafile"
**Solution**:
- Check the command name spelling
- Ensure the command is defined in the Elsafile
- Use `elsa list` to see available commands

#### 3. Permission Denied Error
**Problem**: Command execution fails with permission errors
**Solution**:
- Check file permissions on the Elsafile
- Ensure the commands have proper permissions
- Check if the target directories are writable

#### 4. Variable Substitution Not Working
**Problem**: Variables are not being substituted properly
**Solution**:
- Check variable syntax (`$VAR` or `${VAR}`)
- Ensure environment variables are set
- Use proper quoting for complex values

#### 5. Command Conflict Issues
**Problem**: Commands conflict with built-in commands
**Solution**:
- Use `elsa run <command>` for Elsafile commands
- Rename conflicting commands in Elsafile
- Use `elsa list --conflicts` to identify conflicts

### Debugging Tips

1. **Use Verbose Output**: Add `echo` statements to debug command execution
2. **Check Command Syntax**: Ensure proper indentation and formatting
3. **Test Commands Manually**: Run commands directly in the shell first
4. **Validate Elsafile**: Use `elsa list` to verify command parsing
5. **Check Environment**: Ensure required environment variables are set

### Getting Help

- Use `elsa --help` for general help
- Use `elsa run --help` for run command help
- Use `elsa list` to see available commands
- Use `elsa list --conflicts` to see conflicting commands
- Check the main README for additional documentation
